# Environmental Sustainability
Environmental sustainability is one of the most pressing issues of our century. From climate change to pollution, major ills to the environment affect humanity and the biosphere. Given the urgency of action on environmental sustainability our group saw it fit to tackle a challenge using technology, particularly machine learning, to bring about insights in the area of environmental sustainability. Our insights will inform the world on water pollution and the suitability of drinking water.

# Selected Topic & Reasoning
This project will seek to assess the potability of water resources samples conducted at over 3000 sites. This will contribute to an overall effort to encourage high standard drinking water for the health of people. This will also serve to ensure that water resources are safe for biodiversity such as plants and wildlife. All in all, this project will use a water quality lens to assess the health of water resources for public and environmental health purposes.
