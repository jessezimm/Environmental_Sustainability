# Selected Topic & Reasoning

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

# Questions to Answer through Model

We are going to implement a water quality prediction using machine learning techniques. We will use the decision tree classifier model to predicts that the water is safe to drink or not using parameters like Ph value, conductivity, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic_carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and potability. 

# Description of Source Data
